# Synaptic Workshop

This is the repo for Synaptic Workshop at MuleSoft's Meetup 2017. This workshop is divided in 7 sections, and there's a tag for each of them, here are the sections and tags to fast-forward to them:

## Start

This is the starting point, basically this is the result of just running `npm init && npm install synaptic mnist --save`

**Fast-Forwad**: `git clone --branch start https://github.com/cazala/synaptic-workshop.git --depth=1`

## Neuron

This section teaches how to connect two neurons and teach one of them to output 1 when the other one outputs 0

**Fast-Forwad**: `git clone --branch neuron https://github.com/cazala/synaptic-workshop.git --depth=1`

## Layer

This section teaches how to connect two layers of neurons, and teach them to solve an AND gate

**Fast-Forwad**: `git clone --branch layer https://github.com/cazala/synaptic-workshop.git --depth=1`

## Network

This section teaches how to build a feed-forward network and teach it to solve an XOR

**Fast-Forwad**: `git clone --branch network https://github.com/cazala/synaptic-workshop.git --depth=1`

## Trainer

This section teaches how to use synaptic's Trainer to simplify the way the network is trained

**Fast-Forwad**: `git clone --branch trainer https://github.com/cazala/synaptic-workshop.git --depth=1`

## Architect

This section teaches how to use synaptic's Architect to simplify the way the network is built

**Fast-Forwad**: `git clone --branch architect https://github.com/cazala/synaptic-workshop.git --depth=1`

## MNIST

This section takes the network built over the last sections and teaches it to read handwritten digits by using the MNIST dataset

**Fast-Forwad**: `git clone --branch mnist https://github.com/cazala/synaptic-workshop.git --depth=1`
